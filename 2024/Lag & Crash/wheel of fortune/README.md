Unfortunately, we are only able to see 7/8 of the entire pastebin code.
As a non-avid watcher of Wheel Of Fortune, I had to Google what the letters at the bottom meant:

> "wheel of fortune format letters on left and right"

Then, I assumed that the letters below their faces meant that they guessed it & it is on the board.

![win](win.png)

From the above picture, you can tell that the letter is uncovered, so I began guessing..
